Sol
===

Sol is a generic solver for twisty puzzles like the Rubik's Cube.
Sol is heavily inspired by [ksolve](https://github.com/cubing/ksolve), which
was initially created by KÃ¥re Krig and later improved by Michael Gottlieb.

The goal of Sol is to make it easy to create solvers for simple puzzles, and to
achieve performance acceptable for real-world use (of which the main
applications are tools for finding algorithms and random-state scramblers).
