Sol
===

Sol is a generic solver for twisty puzzles like the Rubik's Cube.
Sol is heavily inspired by [ksolve](https://github.com/cubing/ksolve), which
was initially created by KÃ¥re Krig and later improved by Michael Gottlieb.

The goal of Sol is to make it easy to create solvers for simple puzzles, and to
achieve performance acceptable for real-world use (of which the main
applications are tools for finding algorithms and random-state scramblers).


Interface of a `Puzzle`
=======================

All the below is subject to change.

A `Puzzle` object satisfies the following interface:

##`getTransitionTables()`

Method which returns a list of transition tables for the puzzle.
A list of tables is used instead of a single table to allow for breaking a puzzle down into smaller pieces.

All the tables should have the same moveset (TODO: at the very least we should verify that they have the same size of moveset)

##`getPruningTables()`

Method which returns a list of pruning tables for the puzzle.
The order should correspond to the order given by `getTransitionTables()`.
TODO: should there just be a method that returns a list of objects of ttables and ptables?

##`solved`

A piece of data representing the solved state of the puzzle.
TODO: this should be an accessor?

##`apply(<state-to-apply-to>, <state-being-applied>)`

Takes two states and applies one to the other.

##`index(<state>)`

Map a state to a unique natural number.
The solved state should map to 0.
(TODO: I don't really like this restriction, but I think it's currently depended on. That should be fixed)

This function must be injective, and ideally should be surjective onto the set `{0...<number of states>}`

##`moveEffects`

An object mapping moves to the states they create on a solved puzzle.
TODO: This should maybe be replaced with a function combined with a `moves` property/accessor
