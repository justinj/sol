Sol
===

Sol is a generic solver for twisty puzzles like the Rubik's Cube.
Sol is heavily inspired by [ksolve](https://github.com/cubing/ksolve), which
was initially created by KÃ¥re Krig and later improved by Michael Gottlieb.

The goal of Sol is to make it easy to create solvers for simple puzzles, and to
achieve performance acceptable for real-world use (of which the main
applications are tools for finding algorithms and random-state scramblers).

Issues
======

* The `axes` system is sort of broken and not powerful enough.
It can't describe a situation where you have parallel axes which are not the same face, like in a 3x3 with `L` and `R`.

Easy-ish Tasks
==============

* Allow finding multiple solutions, up to a certain depth, and starting from a certain depth
* split out the orientation that has a backingPerm and the one that doesn't into separate classes
* make the classes use accessors (if it doesn't impact performance too much)
* make the interface of a puzzle more concrete

Difficult-ish Tasks
===================

* Figure out how to automatically determine how to validate states. For example, Skewb corners have a very restricted set of valid perms, but it's not clear how we could tell if a given perm is allowable.
One option is to just check presence in the ttable... but that doesn't help if the different components depend on each other in some way
* Allow restricting moves in solutions
* Related to the above, allow defining new moves in terms of others, but in a more transient way than the existing way of actually defining moves.
This would allow reusing a def of a puzzle for other movesets (like skewb where the moves are all wonky)
